This program will use the broadcasted messages received from the X\+Bee to turn on a L\+ED. Also when the connected button is pressed it will send a message to the other nodes using the attached X\+Bee.

This project was made by second year students from Avans Hogeschool Den Bosch Technische Informatica.
